==================

Advanced jQuery Dialogs

Originally released on the jQuery plugin site before it was nuked.

This plugin enables advanced window and dialog management using the jQuery dialog component.

You have very powerful control over the types of windows you create and their properties such as  
overlay color and opacity.  Create Alert, Info and Prompt dialogs.  Even create borderless windows.

If the script is included in the iframe of the window, it will be ignored because all windows 
communicate with the caller.  This allows windows to be easily stacked and provides a method of 
communication between windows.
